## Swift Interview Data Structures

This repo contains a small library of basic Swift data structures to supplement the standard library. I wrote these so I could practice implementing algorithms based on them during interview prep, because you can't traverse a tree without a tree.

Feel free to use them in your own projects or for interviewing candidates by providing data structures they need. The license is super-permissive, non-attribution - though I would appreciate it if you would star this repo if you use it.

These implementations are meant to be small enough to be copied into into interview environment like Coderpad.

If you notice any bugs I would appreciate it if you would open an issue or submit a pull request and I'll get the fix in ASAP.
