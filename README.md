## Swift Interview Data Structures

This repo contains a small library of basic Swift data structures to supplement the standard library. I wrote these so I could practice implementing algorithms based on them during interview prep, because you can't traverse a tree without a tree.

Feel free to use them in your own projects or for interviewing candidates by providing data structures they need. The license is super-permissive, non-attribution - though I would appreciate it if you would star this repo if you use it.

Each data structure implementation is split into several extensions to make it easy to copy only the required functionality be copied into an interview environment like Coderpad.

If you notice any bugs I would appreciate it if you would open an issue or submit a pull request and I'll get the fix in ASAP.

### Data Structures

This repo contains implementations of these data structures:

* Binary Search Tree
* Singly-Linked List

### Tests

You can open the Package as an xcode project and run the tests by cloning this repo and then running the command `open InterviewDataStructures/Package.swift" from the project root.
